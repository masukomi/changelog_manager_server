# changelog_manager_server

The server companion to [changelog manager](https://github.com/masukomi/changelog_manager). 

This GitHub App will check your PRs for changelog entries generated by the
command-line tool, and mark your PRs with a red X if they're missing one. 


## Geeky details
The Changelog Manager server requires the "Status" and "Pull request" permissions. After being authorized to watch your repo, the Changelog Manager Server will be notified by GitHub whenever you create or update a PR. It will check if that PR includes any files with a path matching this regexp: 

```
  /^\.changelog_entries\/[a-f0-9]{32}\.json$/
```

For example the file in this repo at 

```
  .changelog_entries/75f05f197d0c8f1f014d063016408236.json
```

If a file like that is present it will mark your PR with a successful check. If it is missing it will mark it with a failure (red X). That's it.
